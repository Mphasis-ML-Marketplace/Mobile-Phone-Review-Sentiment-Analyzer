These do what they are suppose to and have not melted in the sun as of yet like other brands have been reported to do. They are on the small side but sufficient.,positive
"These batteries work well, hold a charge well and last at least as long as the OEM battery. The included battery charger works perfectly for the standard battery and I also use it for the extended battery. The batteries do not require a different battery door as they are the same size as the OEM battery. Only downside is that the batteries cannot be charged inside the phone, only in the external charger. Not a deal breaker, but important to know.",positive
What I liked the most about this case was the price. It comes with a stylus pen and screen protector all for a great low price. Case is nice and it keeps your phone protected. I wouldn't recommend the white/pink color though my case got dirty really quick.,positive
"My previous experience with Bluetooth keyboard cases for the iPad was the disappointingiHome Bluetooth Keyboard and Leather Case for iPad 2 - Black (IH-IP2100)that had a flexible keyboard that was difficult to type on and a cheap feeling case. This unit is much better on both counts. The keyboard case has an aluminum back, and a solid feel. The case is much stiffer, and uses a clever series of magnetic latches to lock it closed, and to keep the keyboard in place. Battery life is very good, and the bluetooth system links up to my iPad quickly, with no errors.I'm not crazy about the typing feel of the keyboard, though. It compares poorly to the stock Apple bluetooth keyboard, and I make a lot more typing errors on the Adesso keyboard. There's something about the feel that's not quite right, and the spacing is much too close, compared to the Apple keyboard or other full-size keyboards. I'm not sure it's a huge improvement over the virtual keyboard don the iPad, although using an outboard keyboard  you do get a larger viewing surface while typing.I also had a few instances when I was using the keyboard with a web forum in which the system locked up- it wasn't responsive to either keystrokes or screen taps or swipes. Pressing the Home button unlocked this, but it also terminated the browser. This mainly seemed to happen with forum apps like phpBB.On the whole, I think this is a well made, well engineered device, but I'm not sure the added functionality is enough to justify the additional bulk and complexity. For those occasions when you really need a physical keyboard, it's probably better to use a laptop instead of an iPod. Your preferences may be different than mine, of course, and if you're looking for a reasonably well made Bluetooth keyboard system for an iPad, this isn't a bad choice.",negative
"I think this is one of the better looking / better protecting cases out for the Nexus 4. The back has a nice smooth feel while still being sort of &#34;grippy&#34;. The case goes on easily and holds itself to the phone securely without being too tight to take back off. It slides into my pocket easily and doesn't seem to pick up very much lint. The back piece does mar kind of easily, but it's easy enough to rub marks out - I can't ever tell anything was there.I would recommend this phone case!",positive
This is a lightweight phone with good battery life and quickly processes demanding apps like Navigation. I'm still not a huge fan of Virgin Mobile but the phone itself is 5 stars.,positive
"Very nice backup power.  Elegant design. Handy.  Functional.  Reliable, so far.It is a good stop-gap measure for those times when you haven't planned ahead properly and find your power bottoming out.  It allows me to be very mobile.Versatile, too.  I use it for 4 different types of devices.  It will charge anything that power from USB.",positive
"nice, fun to change up the colors, fits in pocket better than an ottter box.. . . . . . .",positive
"Nothing more to say, other then the title.Basically, they're good for music.Very bad quality for voice calls. Other party hears everything but your voice.Bad engineering of microphone may be..My reviews are based on my experience with iPhone pairing.Also, motorolla's bluetooth are good for phone, but pathetic for music.So really concerned what next bluetooth headphone to buy...Unfortunately my head phone got stolen or lost, else I would definitely return my current ones.Won't recommend to buy, if you are planning to use it for voice calls.To the makers of this item (jWin), Is that a problem with only one headphone in particular - or that's all big bug?",negative
"After receiving the case and installing, the top and bottom lip of the case was so warped it would not fit on my wife's iPhone 5. It almost seemed like the case was too small. Sent back and ordered the ANLEY Candy Fusion Slim Fit (Mint) and fits perfect. Wife really likes the ANLEY.",negative
